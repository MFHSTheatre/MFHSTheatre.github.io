  Darren started his career in lighting design while working on Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor
  Dreamcoat presented by Alief Kerr High School. He then continued to further his understanding in 
  light and how it helps to tell stories and evoke emotion. Darrin attended Southeastern Oklahoma 
  State University as his undergraduate artistic development. During his undergraduate research, 
  Darrin worked at a variety of venues and explored other disciplines in order to gain practical 
  experience, see a unique perspective of light and storytelling. He not only designed for theatre
  in the academic setting but also found knowledge outside of his field that would be a great benefit
  in his career. These included computer programming, electrician work, design work, photography, 
  video production, radio production, and company internships.
